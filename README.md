## TODO

- [ ] Add a button to untrack current tab 
- [ ] Come up with a secure way to support password for obs ws authentication. 
- [ ] Store the setting in a local json file, and make it modifiable inside popup window. For now, it's hardcoded in the `background.js` file as `targetObsInputName`.	
- [ ] Track both the audio and title of the tab, so that it can be used to display browser tab as a playlist. For now, we need to manually track the audio in a separate tab.
